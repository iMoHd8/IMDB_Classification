# IMDB-Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying movie reviews from the IMDB dataset into either positive or negative sentiment categories. The classification is achieved using the Logistic Regression algorithm, with prior data preprocessing for optimal results.

## Algorithm Used
Logistic Regression Algorithm

## Data Processing
Preprocessing steps were applied to the dataset to enhance model performance. This includes tasks such as text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.

## Model Performance
- Model Accuracy: 89.40%
- Training Accuracy: 90.16%
- Testing Accuracy: 88.65%

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from IMDB, containing a collection of movie reviews labeled with sentiment categories.

## Training-Testing Split
The dataset was divided into training and testing sets with a 70% training and 30% testing split.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required Libraries installed.
3. Run the main script to train and test the model.
4. You can also use the trained model for your own classification tasks.
